This JSON parser was stolen from [Maciej Hirsz's](https://github.com/maciejhirsz) excellent
[json crate](https://github.com/maciejhirsz/json-rust), and modified to produce a custom
internal value.

The code was dual-licensed under both Apache and MIT, and both original licenses are
reproduced in this folder.
